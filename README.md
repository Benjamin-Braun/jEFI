# jEFI

The <a href="https://www.github.com/Mad-Mushroom/J-Operating-System">J Operating System</a> remade in UEFI, instead of Legacy BIOS.

## The Name
I was inspired by the J Operating System from Terry Davis. I wanted the scheme of just a letter, so I went to a website to generate a random letter for my OS. The letter was, I kid you not, "J". Therefore I thought fyck it, I'll call it J Operating System (jOS).

Another reason I went with a letter, is the following. I can call anything for it (like a Graphics Library) it with the letter (I. e. jGL).
